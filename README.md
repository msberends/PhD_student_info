# PhD Student Info
This is a simple repo with info for my PhD students.

This was written by a mere microbiologist, so don't blame me. 


# First Steps

## Register

You need to register at our Graduate School for Medical Sciences, GSMS. Remember the abbreviation, it will come up a lot. Their PhD student progress system is called Hora Finita, which are the words you will hear after defending your thesis, moments before getting your doctorate!

Register here: <https://horafinita.rug.nl/registratie/>

## PhD Regulations

Familiarise yourself with our PhD regulations, which can be found here: <https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/rules-and-regulations/onderzoek/promotiereglement?lang=en>.

The Dutch 2022 version [can be found here](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/rules-and-regulations/onderzoek/8feb2022-promotiereglement.pdf). 

## Scientific Code of Conduct

Soon in your PhD, you will have to promise to comply with the Dutch scientific code of conduct. You can find and sign it in Hora Finita. 

After your PhD defense, minutes before receiving your doctorate, you will take an oath that binds you legally to this code as a scientist. 

You can find the code here: <https://www.nfu.nl/themas/randvoorwaarden-wetenschappelijk-onderzoek/wetenschappelijke-integriteit>. 

Since you are a PhD student at a Dutch UMC (university medical centre), you might also be interested in the NFU guidelines for PhD trajectories: <https://www.nfu.nl/themas/randvoorwaarden-wetenschappelijk-onderzoek/promotietraject>


# Useful Resources

## Publishing

### Cite Software

Our uni allows free use of [EndNote](https://endnote.com) (by Clarivate) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) (by Elsevier) is always free to use. I find [Papers](https://papersapp.com) (by ReadCube) to work best for me. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) would be a great option if you're working with dynamic programming files to manage your references. 

Two important advices: **pick one SOON** and **use it ALL THE TIME**. You really don't want to find yourself lost in references when you start writing your manuscript. 

Transferring between software has been made easy, so that's no problem. 

### Journal Browser

The UG has an awesome journal browser: <https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/rugbrowser?title=*>

Importantly, it indicates where the APC will be discounted.

These are free for us to publish in, microbiology/infectious disease journals: <https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/rugbrowser?q=Microbiology%20OR%20Infectious%20Diseases&wq_flt=journal/apc&wq_val=No%20costs%20for%20RUG%20authors&wq_srt_desc=citescore&wq_max=100>

They use CiteScore instead of Journal Impact Factor (JIF or IF); the difference is that CiteScore is the number of citations divided by articles over the past three years, while the JIF does that for the last two years. So they are quite similar though the CiteScore would be less wobbly.

You can also click on further links in the browser and you’ll be redirected to Scopus for specific journal info. It’s really nice!

## Programming / Code

Do realise that as a PhD candidate, you're considered a 'student' in many foreign countries. That comes with a lot of benefits regarding software. So check websites and services if you can apply for free - sometimes you can.

### GitHub

You can apply for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) for free, and enjoy its benefits. Use your UMCG address - they'll know you're eligible.

### Adobe Creative Suite

Via [SurfSpot](https://www.surfspot.nl), you can get the full Adobe Creative Suite in all of its glory for € 20 per year, using your UG/UMCG acount.
