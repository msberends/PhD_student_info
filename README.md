## First Steps

### Register

To begin your PhD journey, it's crucial to register with our Graduate School for Medical Sciences (GSMS). You'll encounter the abbreviation GSMS frequently during your studies. Keep in mind that GSMS manages the PhD student progress system known as Hora Finita, a term you'll often hear just before you receive your doctorate after successfully defending your thesis.

You can initiate your registration [here](https://horafinita.rug.nl/registratie/).

### PhD Regulations

Familiarise yourself with our PhD regulations, which are accessible [here](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/rules-and-regulations/onderzoek/promotiereglement?lang=en).

For the Dutch 2022 version, you can find it [here](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/organization/rules-and-regulations/onderzoek/8feb2022-promotiereglement.pdf).

### Scientific Code of Conduct

At some point during your PhD journey, you'll be required to commit to adhering to the Dutch scientific code of conduct. This commitment can be made within Hora Finita. After successfully defending your PhD, just before receiving your doctorate, you'll take an oath that legally binds you to this code as a scientist.

You can access the code of conduct [here](https://www.nfu.nl/themas/randvoorwaarden-wetenschappelijk-onderzoek/wetenschappelijke-integriteit).

As a PhD student at a Dutch UMC (university medical centre), you may also find the NFU guidelines for PhD trajectories of interest. They are available [here](https://www.nfu.nl/themas/randvoorwaarden-wetenschappelijk-onderzoek/promotietraject).

## Project Management

Your PhD represents one of the most significant projects in your life, and you'll be in charge. This means you'll need effective tools to manage it. Fortunately, both the UG and the UMCG offer valuable support.

The UG, through GSMS, provides free project management courses designed specifically for PhD students. Additionally, UMCG provides you with a Microsoft account that includes Microsoft Planner and Microsoft To Do. Microsoft Planner is particularly useful for managing tasks across multiple projects. However, feel free to choose the tools that best suit your needs, even if you prefer traditional paper-based methods.

- You can access the online version of Planner [here](https://tasks.office.com).
- To use the online version of To Do, visit [this link](https://todo.microsoft.com).

Both services have dedicated apps available for both iOS and Android.

Both the UG and UMCG also offer generous cloud storage options and excellent synchronization software (see OneDrive and Unishare below), ensuring your valuable work is always accessible and secure.

Remember that participating in conferences and seminars not only benefits your academic growth but also expands your professional network and opens doors for potential collaborations.

### Networking

Building a professional network is a crucial aspect of your academic journey. Here are some essential platforms to consider for networking:

#### LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a powerful professional networking platform. Create a comprehensive LinkedIn profile that highlights your academic achievements, research interests, and goals. Connect with fellow researchers, professors, and professionals in your field. Join relevant groups and engage in discussions to stay informed about industry trends and opportunities.

#### ResearchGate

[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) is a platform dedicated to academics and researchers. It allows you to share your publications, connect with peers, and follow the work of others in your field. You can also ask and answer research-related questions, fostering intellectual exchange.

#### ORCID

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) provides a unique identifier for researchers. It ensures that your work is correctly attributed to you and enhances your visibility in the academic community. Register for an ORCID iD and link it to your research outputs.

#### Google Scholar

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is a widely used academic search engine. Create a Google Scholar profile to showcase your publications and citations. It's an essential tool for tracking the impact of your research and finding collaborators with similar interests.

#### The Importance of Internet Outreach

In today's digital age, internet outreach is vital for researchers. Your online presence not only enhances your academic credibility but also makes you more discoverable by peers, potential collaborators, and employers.

By actively networking and maintaining a strong online presence, you'll enhance your research visibility and create opportunities for collaborations and knowledge exchange that can significantly benefit your academic and professional journey.

## Useful Resources / Links

### Publishing

#### Reference Management Software

Our university provides free access to [EndNote](https://endnote.com) (by Clarivate), although more kinds of reference management software are useful:
- [Papers](https://papersapp.com) (by ReadCube)
- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) (by Elsevier)

In my experience, Papers is the most effective choice. If you're dealing with dynamic programming files to manage your references, consider [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org).

Two important pieces of advice: **choose one EARLY** and **use it ALL THE TIME**. It's essential to avoid getting overwhelmed with references when you begin writing your manuscript. Also, in a later phase, you will want to be able to go back to older papers you read. Be sure to have them organised.

Fortunately, switching between software options is relatively straightforward, although it may require some effort.

#### Journal Browser

The UG offers an excellent journal browser, which you can access [here](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/rugbrowser?title=*). It's worth noting that this tool indicates where the Article Processing Charge (APC) will be discounted.

For those of us involved in microbiology and infectious disease research, there are free-to-publish journals listed [here](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/rugbrowser?q=Microbiology%20OR%20Infectious%20Diseases&wq_flt=journal/apc&wq_val=No%20costs%20for%20RUG%20authors&wq_srt_desc=citescore&wq_max=100). These journals use CiteScore instead of Journal Impact Factor (JIF or IF), providing a more stable metric. 

Additionally, you can follow further links in the browser to access specific journal information on Scopus.

### Data Storage / Syncing

#### UWP (University Workspace)

The UG provides access to the *universitaire werkplek* (UWP, university workspace) for all PhD students. This includes a desktop environment with various useful software applications. You can log in [here](https://uwp.rug.nl) using your P-number and UG password.

#### OneDrive

Your UMCG email address serves as a Microsoft account and offers numerous benefits. It allows you to install Office desktop applications on up to 5 computers and install Windows on (I believe) 2 computers. Additionally, it provides access to many Microsoft services for free.

OneDrive, with 1 TB (1024 GB) of cloud storage, is one of these benefits. Visit [their website](https://onedrive.live.com), download, and install OneDrive, then log in with your UMCG account.

#### Unishare

The UG also offers a data storage service called Unishare, which is essentially a [Nextcloud](https://www.nextcloud.com) instance. It's immediately accessible without the need for setup. Importantly, data is stored on UG servers, ensuring your data remains within the university.

All staff members, including PhD students, receive 250 GB of cloud storage. You can also create guest accounts for collaborative research with other universities. Log in [here](https://unishare.rug.nl) using your P-number and UG password. Synchronization with your local operating system can be achieved by downloading and installing the [Nextcloud sync client](https://www.nextcloud.com/install).

### Programming / Code

As a PhD candidate, you're often classified as a 'student' in many foreign countries, which comes with software benefits. It's worthwhile to explore websites and services to determine if you're eligible for free access, as you might discover valuable resources.

#### Hábrók (High-Performance Cluster)

Hábrók is the high-performance cluster (HPC) at the UG, succeeding Peregrine. To use it, you'll need to register. Hábrók allows you to run computationally intensive background jobs that may exceed the capabilities of your personal device.

For more information, please visit [this link](https://wiki.hpc.rug.nl/habrok/start), or don't hesitate to reach out to me for assistance.

#### GitHub

You can apply for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) for free, which provides access to valuable resources and benefits. Be sure to use your UMCG email address for eligibility.

#### Adobe Creative Suite

Through [SurfSpot](https://www.surfspot.nl), you can access the full Adobe Creative Suite at a cost of €20 per year, using your UG/UMCG account. This suite includes a comprehensive set of creative tools and applications that can be invaluable for various aspects of your research and presentations.

Please feel free to reach out if you require more detailed information or assistance with any of these resources or if you have any other questions related to your PhD journey. Remember that you have a wealth of support and tools at your disposal to make your research and studies as productive and successful as possible.
